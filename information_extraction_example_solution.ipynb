Secretary-General António Guterres is in Nigeria, where he warned Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine is leading to a growing hunger crisis in Africa. A new report by Human Rights Watch finds the Russian invasion of Ukraine has worsened food insecurity, particularly for African countries that were already experiencing a hunger crisis. Russia and Ukraine are leading exporters of wheat and other grains, while countries such as Cameroon, Nigeria and Uganda are among the largest importers. With climate change and trade stalled by the coronavirus pandemic, &#8220;all these changes within the availability of food has sent the food prices to new levels,&#8221; says Lena Simet, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.

We speak with Andrew Perez of The Lever about what Ohio&#8217;s elections mean for the future of the Democratic Party if it actively suppresses candidates like Turner who are critical of the establishment. Given that a majority Democratic Congress and sitting Democratic president have not delivered on campaign promises such as canceling student debt, protecting Roe v.

Deborah Shaffer, who co-directed the film with Stewart Bird, says the <span class=\"caps\">IWW</span> &#8220;was founded in 1905 out of necessity&#8221; because no existing unions represented so-called unskilled labor. &#8220;The workers had no representation at all, and they were being expected to work seven days a week, 12-hour days, no breaks, no meals, underpaid, overworked,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Conditions were terrible and intolerable.&#8221; The high-definition rerelease of &#8220;The Wobblies&#8221; comes after the Library of Congress added it to the National Film Registry in 2021.\n","Climate change is forcing animal migrations at an unprecedented scale, bringing many previously disconnected species into close contact and dramatically raising the likelihood of viruses leaping into new hosts and sparking future pandemics. That&#8217;s according to a new study in the journal Nature, which predicts that climate-driven disruptions to Earth&#8217;s ecosystems will create thousands of cross-species viral transmissions in the coming decades. We speak with The Atlantic&#8217;s Ed Yong, who says this new era can be thought of as the &#8220;Pandemicene,&#8221; a time defined by the power of viruses over humanity and the wider world. &#8220;In a warming world, we&#8217;ll get lots of these spillover events in which viruses find new hosts, mostly transferring between animal to animal but increasing the odds that they will eventually then spill over into us,&#8221; says Yong.\n","Nuclear watchdogs are expressing alarm over safety conditions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been under Russian control since early March after a fight that led to a fire near one of the plant&#8217;s reactors.

The Ukrainian government accused Russia of launching two missiles that flew over the plant earlier this week, and says Russian missiles have also flown near two other nuclear power plants in the country. Ukrainian energy expert Olexi Pasyuk, deputy director of the group Ecoaction, notes that Russian forces likely already disturbed radioactive materials at the Chernobyl zone, scene of the world&#8217;s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. &#8220;Zaporizhzhia, where you have reactors in operation and they continue to work now, is a far more dangerous situation,&#8221; says Pasyuk.\n","Russia Bombs Kyiv as U.N.

Biden suspended the policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, shortly after taking office, but Texas and Missouri challenged the move. &#8220;This is a pretty outrageous idea that a new president coming into office is not allowed to dismantle his predecessor&#8217;s programs that he disagrees with,&#8221; says Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior policy counsel at the American Immigration Council.
