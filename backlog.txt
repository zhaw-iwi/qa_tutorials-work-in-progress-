doc = Document("Ukraine Accuses Russia of Firing Missiles Over 3 Nuclear Power Plants, Raising Fear of a New Disaster")
[list/map of extractions] = [specific extraction](doc)

1) Named Entities
entities = extractEntities(doc)
# Result is a Map, e.g.

# Ukraine: [Place, PopulatedPlace, Country],
# Russia: [Place, PopulatedPlace, Country],
# Missile: [...],
# 3: [Number],
# Nuclear power: [...],
